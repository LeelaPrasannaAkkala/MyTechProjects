## Confirmatory Factor Analysis
The Confirmatory Factor Analysis model is used to identify which manifest variables are related to a particular factor when the other manifest variables are restricted to having zero loadings on the other factors.
Based on exploratory factor analysis, a conceptual model relating latent variables to observed variables was developed and tested using CFA. Model fit was evaluated.

## Big Data Strategy - Youtube
  YouTube has built one of the largest big data platforms in the world .  Immense amounts of video viewing data it collects each day from its billions of users. The company leverages Google's massive cloud infrastructure to store hundreds of petabytes of video content and metadata generated. YouTube analyzes this unparalleled trove of data through sophisticated analytics and machine learning algorithms to gain valuable insights into trending topics, popular creators, and individual user preferences.  
  Big data fuels YouTube's highly personalized recommendation engines that drive most of the time spent on the platform by surfacing new videos users might enjoy. The data also optimizes YouTube's targeted digital ad platforms through precise audience profiling and segmentation. In addition, YouTube's big data capabilities underpin features like automatic copyright enforcement through Content ID and provide creators with audience analytics to improve video performance. Overall, big data is at the core of YouTube's strategy, empowering every step from content to monetization.
