## Confirmatory Factor Analysis
The Confirmatory Factor Analysis model is used to identify which manifest variables are related to a particular factor when the other manifest variables are restricted to having zero loadings on the other factors.
Based on exploratory factor analysis, a conceptual model relating latent variables to observed variables was developed and tested using CFA. Model fit was evaluated.
